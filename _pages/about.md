I am Joyanta (joh-yohn-toh). <be />
 <p>
I work on latest wearable technologies at Samsung R&D Institute, Bangladesh *(SRBD)*. Currently I am working on projects involving design & development of multiple system apps on Tizen & android wearOS platform for upcoming Galaxy watches. <be />
I had graduated from *Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)* in October, 2018. I completed my undergrad thesis under the
 supervision of <a href="http://msrahman.buet.ac.bd/">Dr. M. Sohel Rahman</a> and am still in active research with him. <be />
  <p>
My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Computational Biology, Bioinformatics and Applied machine learning. <be /> 
 I love to apply knowledge of computer science in developing intelligent systems for solving real-world issues including basic biological problems. I am also interested
 to work on health informatics and precision medicine that may facilitate better healthcare for all. <be />

 <p>
Alongside professional activities, I love to voluntarily partake in social, charitable and environmental activities. I like to travel and meet new people. In my free time,
I read books, watch anime and play strategy games. I am a big fan of AOE2, EUIV & HOI4.
