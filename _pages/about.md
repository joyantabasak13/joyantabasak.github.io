I am Joyanta (joh-yohn-toh). <be>
 <p>
I work on latest wearable technologies at Samsung R&D Institute, Bangladesh <em>(SRBD)</em>. Currently I am working on projects involving design & development of multiple system apps on Tizen & Android wearOS platform.</p>
   <p>
I had graduated from <em>Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)</em> in October, 2018. I completed my undergrad thesis under the
supervision of <a href="http://msrahman.buet.ac.bd/">Dr. M. Sohel Rahman</a> and am still in active research with him.</p>
  <p>
My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Computational Biology, Bioinformatics and Applied machine learning.  <br /> 
I love to apply knowledge of computer science in developing intelligent systems for solving real-world issues including basic biological problems.</p>
<p> I am also interested to work on health informatics and precision medicine that may facilitate better healthcare for all.</p>
<p>
Alongside professional activities, I love to voluntarily partake in social, charitable and environmental activities. I like to travel and meet new people. Learning to play guiter and feeding birds (mostly crows and pigeon) are my favourite pandemic pastimes. </p>
