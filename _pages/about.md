My name is Joyanta Basak. I am a CSE graduate from *Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)*. I completed my undergrad thesis under the
 supervision of Dr. M. Sohel Rahman and am still in active research with him.
 My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Computational Biology, Bioinformatics and Applied machine learning. 
 I love to apply knowledge of computer science in developing intelligent systems for solving real-world issues including basic biological problems. I am also interested
 to work on health informatics and precision medicine that may facilitate better healthcare for all. <be />

Alongside academic activities, I love to voluntarily partake in social, charitable and environmental activities. I like to travel and meet new people. In my free time,
I read books, watch anime and play strategy games. I am a big fan of AOE2, EUIV & HOI4.
