What are the chances Somebody will guess your Mobile pattern lock?
======
While I was teaching about probability in my Discrete Mathematics class, I came across this problem. I tried to solve it by counting all the simple paths in the graph. My approach was to systematically generate the paths leveraging the symmetry of grids and thus reduce almost 3/4 th of the computation. But I could not find an exact formulae to count them. <br />

Details of my thoughts on this is in this <a href="https://joyantabasak13.github.io/files/On_Mobile_Lock_Pattern.pdf">article</a>.<br />

Conclusion: Don't use the pattern lock anymore. A simple 3*3 grid has only 310 patterns of length 3 or more.
Try fingerprint Lock.
