How Many patterns are there for Mobile grid lock?
======
I usually use pattern lock to turn on display in my Samsung mobile set. I was curious to see what are the odds that a clever person can guess my pattern. So I 
counted the possible patterns. Details can be found in this [writing] (https://joyantabasak13.github.io/files/On_Mobile_Lock_Pattern.pdf) .
FYI, A simple 
3*3 grid has 310 patterns of length 3 or more.
