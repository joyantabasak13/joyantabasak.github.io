In this IOT project, out team (fantastic five!) developed a secured cashless Vending Machine prototype designed for BUET
students & employees. It used **Raspberry Pi 2** for automation & remote communication. <br />
* Each recipient was uniquely identified by **2 step verification**: *ID card barcode scan* & *fingerprint cross check*.
* Payment dues & inventory status were reported to a remote server by deployed Vending Machine prototype.  <br />
