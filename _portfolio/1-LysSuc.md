* Developed an efficient computational tool on CPLM-2.0 database which proposed a prediction scheme
based on evolutionary conserved information of protein sequences. The study explored the efficacy of
protein sequence based features and protein secondary structure for predicting Lysine Succinylation
sites using machine learning techniques.
* Supervised by [Dr.Md Sohel Rahman](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=msrahman), Professor, CSE, BUET.
