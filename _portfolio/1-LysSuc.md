Abstract
---------
Post-translational modification (PTM) is a biological mechanism that expands protein functionality.
Among the PTMs, lysine succinylation substantially alter the structural and functional properties of
cellular proteins. This PTM is suspected to be implicated in numerous diseases regarding heart and
blood circulation. Recent proteomic studies spotted it in wide variety of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
organisms. In reality, little is known about this particular PTM and its implications. The experimental
detection of lysine succinylation is expensive, time consuming and labor extensive. Which is why fast and
robust computational tools are absolutely necessary to process rapidly increasing number of sequenced
proteins and correctly categorize the concealed lysine residues. In this paper, we propose an efficient
model that optimizes different sequence based representations to approximate discriminating function.
This model reflects the efficacy of sequence information by achieving **89% accuracy, 84.9% sensitivity,
92.8% specificity, 0.781 Matthews correlation coefficient, 0.947 AUROC and 0.946 AUPR,** which is the
best overall performance achieved by any predictor in lysine succinylated site prediction.
